# 4.2: Implement data and infrastructure protection strategies

- Enforce a data classification scheme.
- Create, manage, and protect encryption keys.

## Implement encryption at rest (for example, AWS Key Management Service

[AWS KMS]).

- Public service - public zone. Create and Manage Criptographic Keys - Handle Encryption and Decryption
Keys never leave produc. Provides FIPS 140-2(L-2)
- KMS are logical - ID, Date, Policy, Desc and State
- Backed by physical key material
- Generated or imported
- KMS keys can be used for up to 4KB of data
- AWS & Customer owned keys
- Isolated to a region & never leave
- KMS has a key policy - key allow accounts to manage it. "Principal"...

### How it works

[How keys work](../../images/KMS.png)

- KMS doesn't store DEKs keys - (Plain Version and CypherText are provided) After using the plain version key, that is discard and only the encrypted key and data are stored.
DEKs. [See details here](../../images/Services-using-KMS.png)


 Implement encryption in transit (for example, AWS Certificate Manager [ACM],
VPN).
 Securely store secrets by using AWS services (for example, AWS Secrets
Manager, Systems Manager Parameter Store).
 Review reports or findings (for example, AWS Security Hub, Amazon
GuardDuty, AWS Config, Amazon Inspector).
