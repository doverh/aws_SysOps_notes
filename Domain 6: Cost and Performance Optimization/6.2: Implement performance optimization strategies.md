# Task Statement 6.2: Implement performance optimization strategies

## Recommend compute resources based on performance metrics

## Monitor Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) metrics and modify

You can use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (Amazon DLM) to automate the creation, retention, and deletion of Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshots. You can create a lifecycle policy that includes specific tags to back up EBS volumes on a specified schedule and for a specified retention period. For example, you can take a snapshot of an EBS volume every day and keep the snapshots for 30 days. 
configuration to increase performance efficiency.

## Implement S3 performance features (for example, S3 Transfer Acceleration, multipart uploads)

## Monitor RDS metrics and modify the configuration to increase performance efficiency (for example, Performance Insights, RDS Proxy)

## Enable enhanced EC2 capabilities (for example, Elastic Network Adapter, instance store, placement groups)
