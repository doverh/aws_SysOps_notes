# Task Statement 2.2: Implement high availability and resilient environments

## Configure Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and Amazon Route 53 health checks

## Differentiate between the use of a single Availability Zone and Multi-AZ deployments

(for example, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, ELB, Amazon
FSx, Amazon RDS).

## Implement fault-tolerant workloads - for example, Amazon Elastic File System

EC2 uses IAAS (Infraestructure as a service - private service by default - runs in a VPC).
 [Example](../../Files/region-with-availability-zones.png)

Even when EC2 instance has been stopped, is still allocating storage, so charge will apply. Important to terminate instances not being used.

## Amazon EFS, Elastic IP addresses

## Implement Route 53 routing policies (for example, failover, weighted, latency based)

1. FOnce address is available and selected a zone file is created and allocate name services(4 services name services for zone).
2. ALL DNS INFORMATED STORED IN THAT ZONE FILE.
3. ZONE FILE is allocated on managed name servers(4).
4. Comunicates with the .org resgistry and add name servers records into the zone file for the .org top level.
5. (NAME SERVER RECORDS) is how PIR  delegates the admin to our name servers.
