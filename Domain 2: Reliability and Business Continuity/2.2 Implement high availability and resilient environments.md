# Task Statement 2.2: Implement high availability and resilient environments

## Configure Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and Amazon Route 53 health checks

## Differentiate between the use of a single Availability Zone and Multi-AZ deployments

(for example, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, ELB, Amazon
FSx, Amazon RDS).

## Implement fault-tolerant workloads - for example, Amazon Elastic File System

EC2 uses IAAS (Infraestructure as a service - private service by default - runs in a VPC).
 [Example](../../Files/region-with-availability-zones.png)

Even when EC2 instance has been stopped, is still allocating storage, so charge will apply. Important to terminate instances not being used.

## Amazon EFS, Elastic IP addresses

## Implement Route 53 routing policies (for example, failover, weighted, latency based)

Once address is available and selected a zone file is created and allocate name services(4 services name services for zone). NS Name Service records are added to .org / .com (top level domain zone )
