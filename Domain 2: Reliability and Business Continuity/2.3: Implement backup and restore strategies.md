# 2.3: Implement backup and restore strategies

## Automate snapshots and backups based on use cases (for example, RDS snapshots, AWS Backup, RTO and RPO, Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager, retention policy)

AWS Backup is a fully managed backup service that makes it easy to centralize and automate the backup of data across AWS services. The use of tags to assign resources is a simple and scalable way to back up multiple resources. Any resources with the tags that you specify are assigned to the backup plan. A tag policy is a type of service control policy (SCP) in AWS Organizations that can help you standardize and enforce tags across resources in your organization's accounts

## Restore databases (for example, point-in-time restore, promote read replica)

## Implement versioning and lifecycle rules

Versioning of objects are based on ID.(Key can be the same). To delete an object you need to delete the ID.
