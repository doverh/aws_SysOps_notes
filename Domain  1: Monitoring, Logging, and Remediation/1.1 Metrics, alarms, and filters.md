# 1.1 Implement metrics, alarms, and filters by using AWS monitoring and logging services

## 1 Identify, collect, analyze, and export logs (for example, Amazon CloudWatch Logs, CloudWatch Logs Insights, AWS CloudTrail logs)

## Cloud Watch

- Collects and manage operational data
-- metrics - aws products, apps, on premisses
--logs - aws products, apps, on premisses
--events - aws services and schedules

Install stress testing tool
$sudo yum install stress -y
$stress -c 1 -t 3500

## Monitoring Collection

### Logs - app logs, lambda Logs

## CloudTraiL

ou can validate the integrity of AWS CloudTrail log files and detect whether the log files were unchanged, modified, or deleted since CloudTrail delivered them to your Amazon S3 bucket. With a validated log file, you can assert positively that the log file itself has not changed, or that particular user credentials performed specific API activity. The CloudTrail log file integrity validation process also informs you if a log file has been deleted or changed. You gain the insight to assert positively that log files either were delivered or were not delivered to your account during a given period of time. You can activate log file integrity validation with the CloudTrail console when you create or update a trail.

## Log Groups

- Created  to organize logs. Set up retention policy, add tags.

*User-defined tags* are tags that you define, create, and apply to resources manually. You can use Tag Editor to search for all resources and apply tags to them. Use cost allocation tags to track your AWS costs on a detailed level. After you activate cost allocation tags, AWS uses the tags to organize your resource costs to make it easier for you to categorize and track your AWS costs. For example, to track costs by department, you can use a tag that is named "Department" with the value equal to the department name.

- Access using:
-- CloudWatch Logs
-- AWS CLI—The put-log-events uploads batches of log events to CloudWatch Logs.
-- Programmatically — The PutLogEvents API enables you to programmatically upload batches of log events to CloudWatch Logs.
--- Request example:
{
   "logEvents": [
      {
         "message": "string",
         "timestamp": number
      }
   ],
   "logGroupName": "string",
   "logStreamName": "string",
   "sequenceToken": "string"
}

#### Log Stream

- Sequence of log events being monitored;
- Each separate source of logs in CloudWatch Logs makes up a separate log stream.

#### Log Events

- Present an individual event on a log stream(log file)).  

#### Log Insights

- Allow you to interactivelly search and analyze logs in your Cloud Watch
- Discovery Fields
When reads logs generates fields that you can then use in your query.​inserts the @ symbol at the start of fields that it generates.​
Fields will be automatically generated:​
@message — the raw unparsed log event. ​
@timestamp — the event timestamp contained in the log event's timestamp field. ​
@ingestionTime — the time when the log event was received by CloudWatch Logs.​
@logStream — the name of the log stream that the log event was added to. ​
@log — is a log group identifier in the form of account-id:log-group-name.​

- Metrics - variable that is being monitored. e.g data or memory usage

- Events - trigger event based on a condition. e.g every hour take a snapshot of the server, backups?

### Alarms - trigger notifications based on metrics when breaching a threshold

A CloudWatch Alarm monitors a CloudWatch Metric based on a defined threshold
Alarm breaches (goes outside the defined threshold) then it changes state
You can use Amazon CloudWatch alarm actions to create alarms that automatically stop, terminate, reboot, or recover your Amazon EC2 instances. For example, if an instance becomes impaired due to hardware or software issues on the physical host, loss of network connectivity, or loss of system power, you can automatically initiate a recovery action to migrate the instance to new hardware. You also can configure a message to be published to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to receive a notification of the recovery action.

### Metric Alarm States

- OK The metric or expression is within the defined threshold
- ALARM The metric or expression is outside of the defined threshold
- INSUFFICIENT_DATA
The alarm has just started
The metric is not available
Not enough data is available
When it changes state, we can define what action it should trigger:

- ACTION THAT A CHANGE OF STATE TRIGGERS:
Notification
Auto Scaling Group
EC2 Action
You can define Conditions of either a Static or Anomaly Detection

- CONDITIONS:
Static: set a static value as the threshold eg. 100 USD
Anomaly Detection: sets a band around the data points, helps prevent false positives, more flexible if you have seasonal data
Composite Alarms: This allows you to watch multiple alarms and require both to trigger before resulting in an alarm action

The alarms being watch must have no actions sets
It is recommended to set "no action" to reduce alarm noise
You can only trigger an SNS as the action (so no EC2 or ASG actions)

-- Dashboard - visualizations graphs based on metrics provided by AWS CloudwatcH  
-- Container - collects, aggregates and summarize metrics logs from  microservices and containers

#### Service Lens

- Consolidates logs, metrics, traces, alarms from distributed services (isolated services - microservices, containers, databases... ) in a single place.
- Service Maps displays nodes your services endpoints highlighting errors, latency...
- Integrates with CloudWatch Syntetics
- Requirement - deploy X-Ray and Cloud Watch agent

#### Xray

Trace maps to identify services where errors are occuring, services high latency and trace unsucessful requests services  

#### Syntetics

- Test your apps to see if they are broken
- Use Canaries that are configurable scripts that run on a schedule to monitor your endpoints.
You can customize canary scripts to check for changes in:

-- Availability
-- Latency
-- Transactions
-- Broken or dead links
-- Step-by-step task completions
-- Page load errors
-- Load Latencies for UI assets
-- Complex wizard flows

Checkout flows in your application

-- Contributor Insights

### Observability

The ability to measure and understand how internal systems​ work. Answer questions regarding performance, tolerance,​ security, and faults with a system/application.​

- Metrics: number that is measured overtime
- Logs: text file that contains events that happened at certain time
- Traces: history of request travels through apps/services so we can pinpoint performance or failure
-  

## 1.2 Collect metrics and logs by using the CloudWatch agent

Need to install cloud watch agent. Use AWS System Manager (SSM) to get operational insights.
Click on Run Command --> WS-ConfigureAWSPackage --> Install or uninstall a Distributor package. You can install the latest version, default version, or a version of the package you specify.

## 1.3 Create CloudWatch alarms

- Alarms are triggered by events and can lead to an action.

## 1.4 Create metric filters

## 1.5 Create CloudWatch dashboards

Add widgets based on metrics to create a dashboards

## 1.6 Configure notifications (for example, Amazon Simple Notification Service [Amazon SNS], Service Quotas, CloudWatch alarms, AWS Health events)

AWS Health provides ongoing visibility into your resource performance and the availability of your AWS services and accounts. You can use AWS Health events to learn how service and resource changes might affect your applications running on AWS. AWS Health provides relevant and timely information to help you manage events in progress. AWS Health also helps you be aware of and to prepare for planned activities.

(Amazon SNS) is a managed service that provides message delivery from publishers to subscribers (also known as producers and consumers). Publishers communicate asynchronously with subscribers by sending messages to a topic, which is a logical access point and communication channel. Clients can subscribe to the SNS topic and receive published messages using a supported endpoint type, such as Amazon Data Firehose, Amazon SQS, AWS Lambda, HTTP, email, mobile push notifications, and mobile text messages (SMS)
