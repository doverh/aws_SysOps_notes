# 1.2: Remediate issues based on monitoring and availability metrics

## 1. Troubleshoot or take corrective actions based on notifications and alarms

- Actions
- Email notifications
- SMS notofications
- When you use an action in a policy, you usually allow or deny access to the API operation or CLI command with the same name. However, in some cases, a single action controls access to more than one operation. Alternatively, some operations require several different actions.

## 2. Configure Amazon EventBridge rules to invoke actions

Receives event from a source and routes to a target based on rules. See details on [Cheat Sheet](../../Files/AWS_CheatSheet.docx)

## 3. Use AWS Systems Manager Automation runbooks to take action based on AWS Config rules

- Automation created through sequential steps. Add your script inline, or attach it from an S3 bucket or from your local machine. 
- You can automate management of your AWS CloudFormation resources by using the createStack and deleteStack action types. In addition, using the executeAwsApi action type, a step can run any API operation in any AWS service, including creating or deleting AWS resources, starting other processes, initiating notifications, and many more.
