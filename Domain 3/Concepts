3. Deployment, Provisioning, and Automation

3.1: Provision and maintain cloud resources
Create and manage AMIs (for example, EC2 Image Builder).

IAM (Identity and Access Management) Role - Helps to secure control access to AWS resources. With IAM you can centrally manage permissions to which AWS resources users can access. (Implement least privilege).  
Integrate with federated services(Microsoft, Google) that will be assigned roles.

IAM Groups help to manage IAM users --> Create a policy to grant permission - JSON File. By default IAM users can't access anything in your account.
