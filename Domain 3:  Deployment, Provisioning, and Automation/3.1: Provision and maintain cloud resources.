Task Statement 3.1: Provision and maintain cloud resources.

## Create and manage AMIs (for example, EC2 Image Builder).

Use yaml or json file to configure.
Auto scaling groups.
Registering your Auto Scaling group with an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer helps you to: 
set up a load-balanced application. 


 Create, manage, and troubleshoot AWS CloudFormation.
 Provision resources across multiple AWS Regions and accounts (for example,
AWS Resource Access Manager [AWS RAM], CloudFormation StackSets, IAM
cross-account roles).
 Select deployment scenarios and services (for example, blue/green, rolling,
canary).
 Identify and remediate deployment issues (for example, service quotas, subnet
sizing, CloudFormation errors, permissions).

Root account - used only to create a IAM user with administrative permissions attached via policy.

IAM (Identity and Access Management) Role - Helps to secure control access to AWS resources. With IAM you can centrally manage permissions to which AWS resources users can access. (Implement least privilege).  
Integrate with federated services(Microsoft, Google) that will be assigned roles.


IAM Groups help to manage IAM users --> Create a policy to grant permission - JSON File. By default IAM users can't access anything in your account.

IAM Group and Users Steps:

1. Root user create admin IAM admin user group policy
2. Root create IAM user and assign admin group to a user(s)
3. Admin user create IAM group policies
4. Admin assign/revoke policies to users
5. IAM roles can be used to assign permissions temporarily (users, applications assume roles to access resources)
